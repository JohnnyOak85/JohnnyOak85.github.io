                <h3>Junior Full Stack Developer</h3>
                I'm a lover of all forms of art and to me, programming is also art. Creating something from that black
                canvas is already a rewarding experience.
                Being persistent and an early bird means I will start strong and not rest until I find a solution that
                satisfies me.

                <p>September 2019</p>
                A short platforming video game I started as part of a small team of game developers.
                As the sole software developer, I built the main engine of the game using Game Maker Language.
                The project was scrapped and the team disbanded, but I kept the basic skeleton of the engine.<br>

                <h4>Magic Rides</h4>
                <p>April 2019</p>
                A 24 hour "hackathon", final project of &lt;Academia de C&oacute;digo_&gt;. The theme
                was Disney Animation film songs, our group had "A Whole New World" from Disney's
                "Aladdin" and was composed of 6 people. We decided to build a tour guide app. A
                user would create a profile with his interests and then would choose a city to
                visit. The app would then match tour guides who were located on that city and
                had the same interests. This way a person could have a much more personalized
                trip to a city of their choosing. I was in charge of the front end using JavaScript.<br>

                C&oacute;digo_&gt;. Meant to teach us how to build an app from beginning to end,
                constructing the user interface, client/server architecture, relational
                databases and database transactions. Used a Java based back end, MySQL for the databases and with a
