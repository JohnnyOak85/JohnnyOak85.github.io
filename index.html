                <h4>Magic Rides</h4>
                <p>April 2019</p>
                A 24 hour "hackathon", final project of &lt;Academia de C&oacute;digo_&gt;. The theme
                was Disney Animation film songs, our group had "A Whole New World" from Disney's
                "Aladdin" and was composed of 6 people. We decided to build a tour guide app. A
                user would create a profile with his interests and then would choose a city to
                visit. The app would then match tour guides who were located on that city and
                had the same interests. This way a person could have a much more personalized
                trip to a city of their choosing.<br>
